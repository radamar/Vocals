# Roadmap

Vocals is not maintained anymore by the original developer Al-th. Contribution to it has been stagnant, and at best unconcerted.

There are some fundamental flaws with how vocals works,
1. very limited actions, only keypress is supported which doesn't allow natural use cases like holding down keys.
2. Configuration is repetitive and time consuming. Allows no way to compose action sequences.
3. No way to compose speech patterns. So you find yourselves repeating commands over and over again. There is no support for looping/recurse commands.
